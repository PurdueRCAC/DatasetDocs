Description
-----------
Dataset Summary<br><br>This dataset contains Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery of burn scars and the associated masks for the years 2018-2021 over the contiguous United States. There are 804 512x512 scenes. Its primary purpose is for training geospatial machine learning models.<br><br>Dataset Structure<br><br>TIFF Metadata<br>Each tiff file contains a 512x512 pixel tiff file. Scenes contain six bands, and masks have one band. For satellite scenes, each band has already been converted to reflectance.<br><br>Band Order<br>For scenes: Channel, Name, HLS S30 Band number<br>1, Blue, B02<br>2, Green, B03<br>3, Red, B04<br>4, NIR, B8A<br>5, SW 1, B11<br>6, SW 2, B12<br><br>Masks are a single band with values:<br>1 = Burn scar<br>0 = Not burned<br>-1 = Missing data<br><br>Class Distribution<br>Burn Scar - 11%<br>Not burned - 88%<br>No Data - 1%<br><br>Data Splits<br>The 804 files have been randomly split into training (2/3) and validation (1/3) directories, each containing the masks, scenes, and index files.<br><br>Dataset Creation<br>After co-locating the shapefile and HLS scene, the 512x512 chip was formed by taking a window with the burn scar in the center. Burn scars near the edges of HLS tiles are offset from the center.<br>Images were manually filtered for cloud cover and missing data to provide as clean a scene as possible, and burn scar presence was also manually verified.<br><br>Source Data<br>Imagery are from V1.4 of HLS. A full description and access to HLS may be found at https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/<br>The data were from shapefiles maintained by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) group. The original data may be found at: https://mtbs.gov/
